      BairesDev delivery teams help companies to develop custom software without hiring permanent software development staff.<br/>
			While working with BairesDev I was mainly allocated to one client in Chicago, a software house that helped lots of clients to leverage their digital platforms.<br/>
			Therefore, during this time, I had to contact multiple managers in different hierarchies of the process, managing my time among them and delivering solutions for various problems.
