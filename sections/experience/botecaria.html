    <div class="description">
      Botecaria is a beer distribution company in activity in Brazil.<br/>
      Although not computer­related, I had a hard work of starting a company from scratch, learning a lot about management, economy, project building, taxes, hiring and everything else that is necessary for rising a startup.<br/>
      I'm a co­owner, part of a team of five people, and had worked a lot in the beginning of the company, until it could keep alive without my presencial work there.<br/>
