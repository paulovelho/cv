    <ul>
      <li><b>Development of mobile applications using Ionic Framework</b></li>
      Ionic Framework is a javascript framework based in Cordova/Phonegap and AngularJS and Angular 7 that converts web applications in mobile apps.
      When working on these projects, I had a strong contact with AngularJS, Cordova libraries and used PHP to build server­side webservices as well.
      <li><b>Server Configuration</b></li>
      Server configuration using docker, CI Integration and Apache configuration.
      <li><b>Development of PHP websites</b></li>
      MVC websites built with PHP, with strong usage of LAMP environment ­ Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP.<br/>
      Some projects needed some acknowledgments on frameworks such as Zend. However, I've built my own object­oriented MVC framework from scratch, so I am really comfortable working with pure PHP code as well.<br/>
      Apache and server configuration necessary.<br/>
      Strong capabilities of JavaScript and libraries such as JQuery and AngularJs.<br/>
      Used front­end technologies as well, such as HTML5 and Twitter Bootstrap.<br/>
      A Ruby on Rails project was also developed. Language was deeply studied and other technologies were also used, such as GitHub and Heroku infrastructure.<br/>
      <li><b>Development of android applications</b></li>
      Two android applications were built, both of them involved media streaming. One was for using VLClib for a MPEG2 movie broadcast and the other one was to make the app communicate with a Chromecast device. Both of> them required strong skills in Android development and capabilities of work alone, integrating with already existing projects.<br/>
      <li><b>Development of Java projects</b></li>
      Worked on different Java Projects, especially one as part of a strong team that developed a whole e­commerce integrating with already­existing systems and databases from Editora Globo, a huge magazine company in Brazil. Other projects included a bar­-administrator system, integrated with pre-­existing mySQL database, built from a legacy code, that required to work by myself.
