    <h4>Trivia</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>I'm also a comedian, journalist and writer, and already published some articles in some different magazines. Articles are generally about some silly themes, like the <i>Tough Guy Race</i> (self-proclaimed the toughest race in the world) or the <i>World cup of non-countries</i>.</li>
      <li>I was already a dance teacher. During the period of 2012 to 2014, I used to dance rockabilly at a bar/club in SÃ£o Paulo. During some time in that period I also worked in the same bar, during friday's and saturday's nights.</li>
			<li>I am a traveller. I've already been on more than 65 countries. I've already done the Camino de Santiago, the Inca trail to Machu Picchu and climbed Killimanjaro.</li>
